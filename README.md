# Netflix_Analysis-Project
              Netflix Movie Intelligence System - Analysis • Recommendation • Spoiler-Protected Reviews

This project focuses on performing a complete end-to-end analysis of Netflix titles, building a movie recommendation system, and generating spoiler-protected reviews using Natural Language Processing techniques.

The project includes three major components:

1. Netflix Data Analysis

•Data cleaning and preprocessing

•Exploratory data analysis

•Insights on genres, ratings, cast, and trends

•Visualizations for better understanding of the dataset



2. Movie Recommendation System

•Uses TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity

•Provides content-based recommendations

•Suggests similar movies based on user input



3. Spoiler-Protected Review Generation

•Automatically generates short reviews

•Detects and hides spoilers in the text

•Produces a clean, user-friendly output




Tech Stack Used

•Python

•Pandas, NumPy

•Matplotlib (for charts)

•Scikit-learn (for TF-IDF and similarity)

•NLP libraries (TextBlob / NLTK based on the implementation)

•Jupyter Notebook for development


This project demonstrates skills in data preprocessing, analysis, machine learning, NLP, and Python scripting.
Ideal for showcasing data science and ML capabilities in a portfolio or for internship applications.
