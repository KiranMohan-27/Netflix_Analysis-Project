# Netflix_Analysis-Project
              Netflix Movie Intelligence System - Analysis • Recommendation • Spoiler-Protected Reviews

This project focuses on performing a complete end-to-end analysis of Netflix titles, building a movie recommendation system, and generating spoiler-protected reviews using Natural Language Processing techniques.

🔎The project includes three major components:

1. Netflix Data Analysis

• Data cleaning and preprocessing

• Exploratory data analysis

• Insights on genres, ratings, cast, and trends

• Visualizations for better understanding of the dataset



2. Movie Recommendation System

• Uses TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity

• Provides content-based recommendations

• Suggests similar movies based on user input



3. Spoiler-Protected Review Generation

• Automatically generates short reviews

• Detects and hides spoilers in the text

• Produces a clean, user-friendly output


📈What I Learned:

• How to load and explore datasets using Pandas.

• Handling missing values and duplicate data.

• Converting and working with date columns in datasets.

• Basic data analysis: counting types, top genres, content per year.

• Visualizing data using Matplotlib: bar charts and pie charts.

• Creating a simple content recommendation system based on genre.

• Managing movie reviews and spoilers with conditional display.

• Organizing a project workflow for a real-world dataset.


💡Tech Stack Used:

• Python

• Pandas, NumPy

• Matplotlib (for charts)

• Scikit-learn (for TF-IDF and similarity)

• NLP libraries (TextBlob / NLTK based on the implementation)

• Jupyter Notebook for development



This project demonstrates skills in data preprocessing, analysis, machine learning, NLP, and Python scripting.
Ideal for showcasing data science and ML capabilities in a portfolio or for internship applications.
